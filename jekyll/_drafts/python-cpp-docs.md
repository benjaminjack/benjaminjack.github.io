In my last blog post, I explained how to set up a hybrid Python/C++ package with proper unit testing. The example package that I described still has one shortcoming: it's missing documentation. In this blog post, I'll explain how generate beautiful documentation extracted directly from the Python and C++ source code.

### Python documentation with sphinx

### C++ documentation with doxygen

### Interfacing doxygen with sphinx using breathe

### Wrap-up and drawbacks
