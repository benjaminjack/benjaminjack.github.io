For my research, I've spent the better part of the last year developing a simulation tool in Python. Python abstracts away things like memory management and type information, making it a great language for working through high-level design decisions. But for simulation software, pure Python is slow. So I've taken to a workflow of prototyping in Python and then rewriting portions of the code base into C++ for performance. I'm left with a high-performance Python package that mixes both Python modules and compiled C++-based extension modules. This combination leverages both the simplicity of Python and the efficiency of C++.

Interfacing C++ code with Python has become relatively easy thanks to several libraries. My favorite is [`pybind11`](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), a header-only C++ library which takes inspiration from `Boost.Python` but vastly simplifies the syntax. `Pybind11` allows you to write Python wrappers (also called bindings) for C++ code and generate a Python extension module with minimal boilerplate code. Going from a module to a proper Python package, however, takes some more work. In my mind, a Python package based on a hybrid Python/C++ code base should include:

- A build system, such as CMake or make
- Unit tests for Python code
- Unit tests for C++ code, independent of Python wrappers
- A unified build-and-test command that builds all extension modules and runs both Python and C++ tests

The aim of this blog post is to describe how to set up a Python package that meets all of the above requirements with minimal external tools or libraries.

The first part of this post closely follows the [`pybind11` introductory tutorial](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics.html) and the [pybind11/CMake example repository](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/compiling.html#building-with-cmake). This post is not meant as an introduction to `pybind11`. If you've never used `pybind11` before, it's worth taking the time now to read through some of the [excellent documentation](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). For Part 1 of this post, I'll assume a general familiarity with `pybind11`.

In the second part of this post, I'll introduce unit testing frameworks for both the Python side and C++ side of our package's code base. For that, we'll use Python's built-in `unittest` module and the [`catch` C++ library](). Lastly, I'll demonstrate how to stitch these testing frameworks together with Python's `setuptools` and `setup.py`.

All the code presented here has been tested with Python 3.6 and a compiler that supports C++11 on macOS Sierra. C++11 support is required by `pybind11`, but the Python code and extension modules generated here should work with either Python 2 or 3. The code should also work on Windows, although I have not tested it. All code in this blog post is available as a complete working example in this [github repository](https://github.com/benjaminjack/python_cpp_example).

### Part 1: A simple `pybind11` project

#### The C++ code

To start, we'll create a simple `pybind11`-based Python module. The module will share the same name as our package, `python_cpp_example`. The directory structure for our package should be familiar to those who have written Python packages before, with a few exceptions, notably `lib`, `build`, and `CMakeLists.txt`:

```bash
python_cpp_example/
├── build  # build directory for C++ executables
├── lib  # external C++ libraries
├── python_cpp_example  # source code (Python and C++)
├── setup.py
└── tests  # unit tests (Python and C++)
```

The `build/` directory will contain compiled code generated by our build system. The `lib/` directory will contain the C++ libraries needed for our package. Under `lib/`, download and extract the latest `pybind11` release by running the following commands (assuming you're working in a *nix environment):

```bash
wget https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/archive/v2.1.1.tar.gz
tar -xvf v2.1.1.tar.gz
# Copy pybind11 library into our project
cp -r pybind11-2.1.1 python_cpp_example/lib/pybind11
```

Now we'll write two simple C++ functions and then wrap them in Python with `pybind11`. Under `python_cpp_example`, create three files: `math.hpp`, `math.cpp`, and `bindings.cpp`. 

`math.hpp` and `math.cpp` are simple C++ header and definition files:

`math.hpp`:
```cpp
/*! Add two integers
    \param i an integer
    \param j another integer
*/
int add(int i, int j);
/*! Subtract one integer from another 
    \param i an integer
    \param j an integer to subtract from \p i
*/
int subtract(int i, int j);
```

`math.cpp`:
```cpp
#include "math.hpp"

int add(int i, int j)
{
    return i + j;
}

int subtract(int i, int j)
{
    return i - j;
}
```

Lastly, we'll define our Python wrappers in a file called `bindings.cpp`. See the [`pybind11` tutorial](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics.html) for a detailed explanation of what each line of code does here.

`bindings.cpp`:
```cpp
#include <pybind11/pybind11.h>
#include "math.hpp"

namespace py = pybind11;

PYBIND11_PLUGIN(python_cpp_example)
{
    py::module m("python_cpp_example");
    m.def("add", &add);
    m.def("subtract", &subtract);
    return m.ptr();
}
```
We've now defined two functions in C++, `add` and `subtract`, and written the code to wrap them in a Python module called `python_cpp_example`. Your directory structure should now look something like this:

```bash
python_cpp_example/
├── build
├── lib
│   └── pybind11
├── python_cpp_example
│   ├── bindings.cpp
│   ├── math.cpp
│   └── math.hpp
├── setup.py
└── tests
``` 

Next we have to set up our build environment. We'll use CMake to build the C++ extension modules in our package.

#### Configuring the build environment

We could have written a Makefile directly to build our package, but using CMake simplifies building `pybind11`-based modules. (If you don't believe me, check out the Makefile that CMake generates.) Using CMake will also make it easier to add C++ unit tests later.

First make sure that you have [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed. On macOS, installation can be done with [`brew`](https://brew.sh) by running the following command:

```bash
> brew install cmake
```

If you are not familiar with CMake, I suggest skimming through the [CMake introductory tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/). We're going to use a small set of CMake functions here, so even if you're new to CMake, the code should be easy to follow.

To start, we'll define a project, set the source directory, and define a list of C++ sources _without_ `bindings.cpp`. (This list will come in handy later when we want build C++ tests independently of any Python bindings.) Create a `CMakeLists.txt` file in the package's root directory and add the following:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.12)
project(python_cpp_example)
# Set source directory
set(SOURCE_DIR "python_cpp_example")
# Tell CMake that headers are also in SOURCE_DIR
include_directories(${SOURCE_DIR})
set(SOURCES "${SOURCE_DIR}/math.cpp")
```

Next, we'll tell CMake to add the `pybind11` directory to our project and define an extension module. This time, make sure `bindings.cpp` is added to the sources list. Add the following to `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# Generate Python module
add_subdirectory(lib/pybind11)
pybind11_add_module(python_cpp_example ${SOURCES} "${SOURCE_DIR}/bindings.cpp")
```

That's all we need to instruct CMake to build our extension module. Rather than run CMake directly, however, we're going to configure Python's built-in [`setuptools`](http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to build our package automatically via `setup.py`.

#### Building with `setuptools`

On its own, `setup.py` will not build an extension module with a CMake-based build system. We have to define a custom build command. The code I'm presenting here was largely taken from the [`pybind11`'s CMake example repository](https://github.com/pybind/cmake_example). I won't explain every line of the code here, but in brief, we're defining two classes that will create a temporary build directory and then call CMake to build any extension modules in our package. Add these two class definitions to `setup.py`:

```python
import os
import re
import sys
import sysconfig
import platform
import subprocess

from distutils.version import LooseVersion
from setuptools import setup, Extension
from setuptools.command.build_ext import build_ext


class CMakeExtension(Extension):
    def __init__(self, name, sourcedir=''):
        Extension.__init__(self, name, sources=[])
        self.sourcedir = os.path.abspath(sourcedir)


class CMakeBuild(build_ext):
    def run(self):
        try:
            out = subprocess.check_output(['cmake', '--version'])
        except OSError:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "CMake must be installed to build the following extensions: " +
                ", ".join(e.name for e in self.extensions))

        if platform.system() == "Windows":
            cmake_version = LooseVersion(re.search(r'version\s*([\d.]+)',
                                         out.decode()).group(1))
            if cmake_version < '3.1.0':
                raise RuntimeError("CMake >= 3.1.0 is required on Windows")

        for ext in self.extensions:
            self.build_extension(ext)

    def build_extension(self, ext):
        extdir = os.path.abspath(
            os.path.dirname(self.get_ext_fullpath(ext.name)))
        cmake_args = ['-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=' + extdir,
                      '-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=' + sys.executable]

        cfg = 'Debug' if self.debug else 'Release'
        build_args = ['--config', cfg]

        if platform.system() == "Windows":
            cmake_args += ['-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_{}={}'.format(
                cfg.upper(),
                extdir)]
            if sys.maxsize > 2**32:
                cmake_args += ['-A', 'x64']
            build_args += ['--', '/m']
        else:
            cmake_args += ['-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=' + cfg]
            build_args += ['--', '-j2']

        env = os.environ.copy()
        env['CXXFLAGS'] = '{} -DVERSION_INFO=\\"{}\\"'.format(
            env.get('CXXFLAGS', ''),
            self.distribution.get_version())
        if not os.path.exists(self.build_temp):
            os.makedirs(self.build_temp)
        subprocess.check_call(['cmake', ext.sourcedir] + cmake_args,
                              cwd=self.build_temp, env=env)
        subprocess.check_call(['cmake', '--build', '.'] + build_args,
                              cwd=self.build_temp)
        print()  # Add an empty line for cleaner output
```

Next, at the bottom of `setup.py`, modify `setup()` with the newly-defined custom extension builder:

```python
setup(
    name='python_cpp_example',
    version='0.1',
    author='Benjamin Jack',
    author_email='benjamin.r.jack@gmail.com',
    description='A hybrid Python/C++ test project',
    long_description='',
    # add extension module
    ext_modules=[CMakeExtension('python_cpp_example')],
    # add custom build_ext command
    cmdclass=dict(build_ext=CMakeBuild),
    zip_safe=False,
)
```

Now you should be able to run `python3 setup.py develop` from within your package's root directory and you will see an extension module generated. You can now import and use your new package. 

Up until now, I have largely followed along with the [`pybind11` tutorial](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics.html) and [`pybind11`'s CMake example repository](https://github.com/pybind/cmake_example). In Part 2, I will describe how to add unit testing within this set up.

### Part 2: Adding unit tests

#### Writing Python unit tests

We'll begin by adding Python unit tests using Python's built-in `unittest` module. Under `tests/` add an empty file called `__init__.py`. This file will stay empty, but it is required for `unittest`'s automatic test discovery.

```bash
python_cpp_example/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── build
├── lib
│   └── pybind11
├── python_cpp_example
│   ├── bindings.cpp
│   ├── math.cpp
│   └── math.hpp
├── setup.py
└── tests
    └── __init__.py
```

In the same `tests/` directory, add a file `math_test.py` with a few simple unit tests.

```python
import unittest
import python_cpp_example  # our `pybind11`-based extension module

class MainTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        # test that 1 + 1 = 2
        self.assertEqual(python_cpp_example.add(1, 1), 2)

    def test_subtract(self):
        # test that 1 - 1 = 0
        self.assertEqual(python_cpp_example.subtract(1, 1), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

That's all you need for Python unit tests. You can add as many test files as you want, and each one should define a class that extends `unittest.TestCase`. As long as all of your files have a `_test.py` suffix, `unittest` will automatically discover them. Run `python3 setup.py test` and you should get output that looks like this:

```bash
> python3 setup.py test
test_add (tests.math_test.MainTest) ... ok
test_subtract (tests.math_test.MainTest) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.001s

OK
```

Python's built-in `unittest` module is a powerful unit testing framework with a variety of built in assertions. You can read more about `unittest` in the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

#### Writing C++ unit tests with `catch`

Unlike Python, C++ needs an external library to enable unit testing. I've chosen to use [`catch`](http://catch-lib.net) for its concise syntax and its header-only structure. Download and extract `catch` in the `lib/` directory of your package. On a *nix system, you could run the following:

```bash
cd lib
wget https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/archive/v1.9.4.tar.gz
tar -xvf v1.9.4.tar.gz
# Copy catch library into our project
cp -r catch-1.9.4 python_cpp_example/lib/catch 
```

Similar to Python's `__init__.py`, `catch` requires an initialization file that we'll name `test_main.cpp`. This configuration file must contain two specific lines and nothing else. Under the `tests/` directory, add the following file:

`test_main.cpp`:
```cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include <catch.hpp>
```

Now we'll make a file with two simple unit tests. This time I'm using a `test_` prefix (rather than a `_test.py` suffix) to easily distinguish between Python unit tests and C++ unit tests without looking at the file extension. Add the following to a file named `test_math.cpp` in the `test/` directory:

`test_math.cpp`
```cpp
#include <catch.hpp>

#include "math.hpp"

TEST_CASE("Addition and subtraction")
{
    REQUIRE(add(1, 1) == 2);
    REQUIRE(subtract(1, 1) == 0);
}
```

These tests are analogous to the Python tests in the previous section. Normally, I would not unit test both the `pybind11` Python wrappers and the underlying C++ definitions for such simple functions. However, you can imagine an instance in which you didn't want to expose all of your C++ code with Python wrappers, but you still wanted to unit test that C++ code. Likewise, the Python wrappers can get quite complex and it may be useful to test your C++ code independently of the wrapping code.

Your directory structure should now look something like this:

```bash
python_cpp_example/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── build
│   └── temp.macosx-10.12-x86_64-3.6
├── lib
│   ├── catch
│   └── pybind11
├── python_cpp_example
│   ├── bindings.cpp
│   ├── math.cpp
│   └── math.hpp
├── python_cpp_example.cpython-36m-darwin.so
├── setup.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── math_test.py
    ├── test_main.cpp
    └── test_math.cpp
```

Lastly, we need to instruct CMake that we've added C++ unit tests. We'll add `test_main.cpp` and `test_math.cpp` to a `TESTS` variable. Then we'll include the `catch` library and define an executable `python_cpp_example_test`. Add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
SET(TEST_DIR "tests")
SET(TESTS ${SOURCES}
    "${TEST_DIR}/test_main.cpp"
    "${TEST_DIR}/test_math.cpp")

# Generate a test executable
include_directories(lib/catch/include)
add_executable("${PROJECT_NAME}_test" ${TESTS})
```

Now run `python3 ./setup.py develop` and if you navigate to `build/temp.*` (e.g., `build/temp.macosx-10.12-x86_64-3.6` on my system), you should see an executable `python_cpp_example_test`. Running this executable will execute the `catch` unit tests. Rather than run this executable ourselves, however, we will tell `setuptools` to run it along side the Python unit tests.

#### Writing a custom test-runner for `setuptools`

Just like we wrote a custom extension builder in `setup.py` in Part 1, we'll write a custom test runner to run both Python and C++ unit tests. Add the following import command and class definition to your `setup.py` file: 

```python
from setuptools.command.test import test as TestCommand

class CatchTestCommand(TestCommand):
    """
    A custom test runner to execute both Python unittest tests and C++ Catch-
    lib tests.
    """
    def distutils_dir_name(self, dname):
        """Returns the name of a distutils build directory"""
        dir_name = "{dirname}.{platform}-{version[0]}.{version[1]}"
        return dir_name.format(dirname=dname,
                               platform=sysconfig.get_platform(),
                               version=sys.version_info)

    def run(self):
        # Run Python tests
        super(CatchTestCommand, self).run()
        print("\nPython tests complete, now running C++ tests...\n")
        # Run catch tests
        subprocess.call(['./*_test'],
                        cwd=os.path.join('build',
                                         self.distutils_dir_name('temp')),
                        shell=True)
```

We're defining a class with two functions. The first function `distutils_dir_name` is just a helper function that generates a path to the CMake build directory. The second function `run`, first runs the Python unit tests, then runs the C++ unit tests by executing `python_cpp_example_test`. This function will run any executable that it finds in the build directory with a `_test` suffix.

Next define a new `test` command at the bottom of `setup.py`.

`setup.py`:
```python
setup(
    name='python_cpp_example',
    version='0.1',
    author='Benjamin Jack',
    author_email='benjamin.r.jack@gmail.com',
    description='A hybrid Python/C++ test project',
    long_description='',
    ext_modules=[CMakeExtension('python_cpp_example')],
    # add custom test command
    cmdclass=dict(build_ext=CMakeBuild, test=CatchTestCommand),
    zip_safe=False,
)
```

And now, the moment we've been waiting for: a single command to build and test a hybrid Python/C++ package.

```bash
> python3 setup.py test
...

test_add (tests.math_test.MainTest) ... ok
test_subtract (tests.math_test.MainTest) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.001s

OK

Python tests complete, now running C++ tests...

===============================================================================
All tests passed (2 assertions in 1 test case)
```

Under the hood, the above command is first building any extension modules, executing Python unit tests, and then executing C++ unit tests.

### Wrap-up

You should now have a functioning, minimal Python/C++ package that is set up to unit test both the Python and C++ code. For a complete working example, see the [github repository](https://github.com/benjaminjack/python_cpp_example) that accompanies this blog post. In my next blog post, we'll learn how to auto-generate documentation for the mixed-language code base presented here.
