<h2>Science</h2>

<p>I am broadly interested in developing statistical and mechanistic models that predict how proteins and micro-organisms evolve. I have a background in "wet lab" work as a former laboratory technologist, although I now consider myself a computational biologist.</p>

<p>At the organism level, I have studied the evolutionary stability of engineered organisms. In synthetic biology, organisms are engineered to produce compounds that they would not otherwise produce. Production of these foreign compounds often has a high fitness cost, so engineered organisms may accumulate mutations that disable this production. In other words, the engineered organisms break. I worked with Jeff Barrick to construct the <a href="http://barricklab.org/efm">Evolutionary Failure Mode (EFM) Calculator</a>, a computational tool that addresses the evolutionary instability of engineered organisms. The EFM Calculator predicts hyper-mutable sites in a given DNA sequence. It allows researchers to test sequences <em>in silico</em> before placing them into organisms. The EFM Calculator began as a rotation project during my first few months of graduate school and I will continue to improve the Calculator's predictions and interface.</p>

<p>At the protein level, I study geometric constraints on protein evolution under the direction of Claus Wilke. In a given protein, different amino-acid sites evolve at different rates. Amino acids near a catalytic site tend to be more conserved than residues elsewhere in the protein, and the protein must fold into the correct form to perform its catalytic activity. It follows, then, that there must be some relationship between the three-dimensional structure of a protein and the rate at which different parts of the protein evolve. Improving our understanding of the physical constraints on protein evolution could give us broad insights into viral protein evolution, drug design, antibiotic resistance, and other areas of study.</p> 

<p>Going forward in the Wilke lab, I plan to transition towards mechanistic modeling. To that end, I will study protein complex formation in <em>E. coli</em> and the evolutionary stability of T7 bacteriophage. I will continue to update this page as plans for my dissertation work become more cohesive.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>Beyond my scientific work, I am interested in software development and especially web development. Most bioinformatics tools are only accessible via the command line and may involve complex installation procedures and dependencies. This often intimidates scientists without computational backgrounds. I believe that one of the best ways to make a tool widely accessible, especially in bioinformatics, is to develop a web interface for that tool. I am most proficient in Python and the R statistical computing language. For back-end web development, I enjoy using Django. I use Javascript for front-end interactive web development. Please see my <a href="https://github.com/benjaminjack" target="_blank">Github page</a> for some of my software development work.</p>
