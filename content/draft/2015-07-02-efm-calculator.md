Most biologists today would define synthetic biology as the integration of engineering principles into the study of biological systems. There are a few key differences between systems that engineers typically deal with (_e.g._, mechanical or electrical) and biological systems. Mechanical systems behave predictably, they are modular, and they generally do not reproduce on their own. Biological systems, by comparison, are messy and unpredictable. Organisms regularly make copies of themselves and they do it imperfectly. These imperfections are mutations. Mutations accumulate after many generations and eventually lead to death or significant changes in an organism. This is the process of evolution.

If none of the above makes sense to you, let us begin with an example. Start with an imaginary organism that takes sunlight and carbon dioxide and converts it into sugar (this is what most plants and algae do). After years of work, you modify this micro-organism to convert sunlight and carbon dioxide directly into gasoline. Congratulations, you have solved the energy crisis! Unfortunately, after several days growing in the laboratory, your new creation seems to have stopped making gasoline and went back to making sugar. Why did this happen? Gasoline production in these organisms takes significantly more energy than the energy required to make sugar. Gasoline production diverts energy away from other important things that the organism could be doing, like reproduction. In biological terms, gasoline production has a high _fitness cost_. Your petri-dish once contained millions of gasoline-producing micro-organisms that constantly grew and replicated, often imperfectly. At some point, one organism in the petri-dish developed a mutation that allowed it to stop producing gasoline and revert to producing sugar. Suddenly, this singular organism had plenty of extra energy to reproduce and make more sugar-producers. So reproduce it did. And it reproduced so much more quickly than all of the other organisms that eventually it out-competed the gasoline-producers for resources. After a few days the gasoline-producers had completely died off and all that remained were the sugar-producers. Due to evolution, your new, carefully engineered, world-changing micro-organism had failed.

Preventing failure of engineered organisms (or synthetic biology devices as they are also referred to) is an ongoing challenge in synthetic biology. The [Evolutionary Failure Mode (EFM) Calculator](http://barricklab.org/efm) attempts to address the evolutionary causes of these failures. Going back to our example above, imagine for a moment that we could make an organism that made perfect copies of itself. Every generation it would faithfully copy its DNA with no changes (_i.e._, no mutations) and pass that DNA on to the next generation. In other words, it would be an organism that _never evolves_. This organism would happily produce gasoline as long as it had the sunlight and carbon dioxide to do so. Exxon Mobil would be either very interested in your work or terrified of the prospect of gasoline as a renewable resource. 

Is building an organism that never evolves possible? Probably not, but we do know that mutations do not all occur randomly. Some DNA sequences are more likely to mutate than others due to the underlying mechanisms of how organisms make copies of their DNA. This is the key principle on which we constructed the [EFM Calculator](http://barricklab.org/efm). The [EFM Calculator](http://barricklab.org/efm) detects hyper-mutable sequences in DNA before that DNA is used to construct a synthetic biology device. Biologists can then make alterations to the DNA and make their devices more _evolutionarily stable_. And maybe one day Exxon Mobil will be shaking in their collective boots.
