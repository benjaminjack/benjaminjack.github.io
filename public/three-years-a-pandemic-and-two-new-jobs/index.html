    </header><p>Hello! It&rsquo;s been three years since my last post. A lot has happened in those three years. I changed jobs twice, I moved across the country from Austin to Philadelphia, and I went from a small start-up to one of the world&rsquo;s largest healthcare conglomerates. All while navigating ever-shifting pandemic conditions. In personal news, I also got engaged to my wonderful partner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;ll be posting about in the future, although I&rsquo;d expect to see some more technical posts and tutorials. I&rsquo;m back to programming and data science as a hobby now, since I do much less coding now for my current job (a topic that deserves a separate post). But I won&rsquo;t make any promises given my track record.</p>
<p>It also seemed like a good time to transition from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. The process was pretty seamless. And so far it seems easier to manage than Jekyll for simple sites.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now, and maybe you&rsquo;ll see me again sooner than another three years from now.</p>
