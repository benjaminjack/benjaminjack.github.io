title: Three years, a pandemic, and two new jobs

Hello! It's been three years since my last post. A lot has happened in those three years. I changed jobs twice, I moved across the country from Austin to Philadelphia, and I went from a small start-up to one of the world's largest healthcare conglomerates. All while navigating ever-shifting pandemic conditions. In personal news, I also got engaged to my wonderful partner.

I'm not sure what I'll be posting about in the future, although I'd expect to see some more technical posts and tutorials. I'm back to programming and data science as a hobby now, since I do much less coding now for my current job (a topic that deserves a separate post). But I won't make any promises given my track record.

It also seemed like a good time to transition from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The process was pretty seamless. And so far it seems easier to manage than Jekyll for simple sites.

That's all for now, and maybe you'll see me again sooner than another three years from now.
