I remember first hearing the term 'data science' around 2015. At the time, I was finishing my first year of graduate school at UT Austin. I had just joined Claus Wilke's lab, and one of my new labmates told me about a program called Insight Data Science. Insight takes newly-minted PhDs and trains them to be data scientists. They define a data scientist as 'better at programming than a typical statistician, and better at statistics than a typical programmer' and this is the definition that stuck with me. I never went through the Insight program, but data science suddenly appeared on my radar as a mysterious, highly in-demand 'alt-academic' career path.

A year earlier, in 2014, Forbes declared Data Scientist the 'sexiest job of the 21st century.' The very first job posting to use the term appeared sometime in 2008. In 2008, I was a freshman at the University of Miami with no major declared. I would eventually graduate with a degree in biochemistry in 2012 and go on to work for the American Red Cross Biomedical Services Division in my hometown of Philadelphia. There I gained an appreciation for how data-driven the field of molecular biology had become. I decided that I'd go to graduate school to study some combination of biology and computer science. My only explicit goal was to do something more interesting than my lab tech position at the Red Cross.

If you ask data scientists who are former academics to define data science, they'll likely tell you that data science is just science. Scientific research has always involved analyzing data, and it has always required statistical skills. More recently, as the volume of data generated by the broader scientific enterprise increases, it also requires programming. This was true of my area of specialization, computational biology. I learned how to manage large data sets, work on a super computing cluster, clean data from protein databases, visualize data, and build all sorts of statistical models. I had, almost by accident, acquired most of the core skills that a data scientist needs. This is part of why you see so many data scientists with PhDs. It's not that you _need_ a PhD to be a data scientist, its that the process of doing original research during a PhD program fosters the development of data science skills.

By late 2015 or early 2016, I had decided that I was unlikely to stay in academia. So, I set out to position myself for a career in data science.
