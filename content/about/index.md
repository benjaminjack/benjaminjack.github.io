!["Benjamin Jack"](/headshot.jpg)

My name is Ben and I am a data scientist. I currently work at <a href="https://valkyrie.ai">Valkyrie Intelligence</a> based in Austin, Texas. I consider myself a data science generalist, so I do a bit of everything from backend data engineering to machine learning to building dashboards. I'm particularly interested in deep learning and its applications in computer vision and natural language processing.
				
Before transitioning into data science, I earned my PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology at UT Austin. There, I studied viral metabolism by constructing intracellular simulations of phage infections. I worked under the direction of <a href="https://wilkelab.org">Claus Wilke</a>.
