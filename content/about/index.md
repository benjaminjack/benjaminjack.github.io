My name is Ben and I'm a data architect at [Kenvue](http://kenvue.com), supporting their global R&D operations. I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with my partner Matthew. This blog contains technical tutorials, essays, side projects, and other musings that seems worth sharing.

I've worked in a few different data-related fields, including data science consulting and software engineering. Previously, I worked for [L7 Informatics](https://l7informatics.com) and [Valkyrie Intelligence](https://valkyrie.ai). Broadly, I'm interested in helping organizations get the most value out of their data---particularly scientific data that is unique the life sciences. 
				
Before transitioning into the private sector, I earned my PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology at UT Austin. There, I studied viral metabolism by constructing intracellular simulations of phage infections. I worked under the direction of [Claus Wilke](https://wilkelab.org).
