			<p>My name is Ben and I am a data scientist. I currently work at Valkyrie Intelligence based in Austin, Texas. I consider myself a data science generalist, so I do a bit of everything from backend data engineering to machine learning to building dashboards. I'm particularly interested in deep learning and its applications in computer vision and natural language processing.</p>
				
			<p>Before transitioning into data science, I earned my PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology at UT Austin. There, I studied viral metabolism by constructing intracellular simulations of phage infections.</p>
			
			<p>Prior to attending graduate school, I earned a BS in Biochemistry from the University of Miami. I then returned to Philadelphia, where I was born and raised, to worked for the American Red Cross Biomedical Services Division.</p>
